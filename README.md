Forecasting fuel demand while accounting for economic factors like inflation enables better operational planning, pricing strategies, and inventory management in the energy sector.

Business Applications:
Demand forecasting for supply chain optimization
Budget planning and resource allocation
Economic impact analysis on consumer behavior
Peak period preparation and capacity planning

ðŸ“Š Forecast Horizon: 52 weeks ahead
ðŸ“ˆ Key Insight: Strong negative correlation (-0.68) between inflation rate and fuel demand
ðŸ“… Peak Demand: April 2025 (105.69 units)
ðŸŽ„ Holiday Forecast: 207.64 units during Christmas period

Dataset

Source: Office for National Statistics (ONS)
Period: January 2021 - February 2025 (214 weeks)
Frequency: Weekly observations
Primary Variable: Estimated quantity demand per transaction
Exogenous Variable: Weekly inflation rate (CPI-based)


Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Duplicate removal and resampling to weekly frequency
Outlier detection and handling using IQR method
Missing value imputation with linear interpolation
Merging fuel demand with inflation data

2. Exploratory Analysis

Seasonal decomposition (additive & multiplicative)
Trend identification and cyclic pattern analysis
Correlation analysis between fuel demand and inflation
Stationarity testing with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

3. Data Transformation

First-order differencing to achieve stationarity
ACF/PACF plots for lag identification
Granger causality test for inflation impact validation

4. Model Development
