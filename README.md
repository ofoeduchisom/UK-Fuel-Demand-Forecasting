## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Removed duplicates, resampled to weekly frequency
* Outlier handling (IQR method)
* Missing values filled using linear interpolation
* Merged demand with inflation data

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

* Seasonal decomposition (additive & multiplicative)
* Trend & cyclic pattern analysis
* Correlation analysis with inflation
* Stationarity testing (ADF test)

### 3. Data Transformation

* First-order differencing for stationarity
* ACF/PACF plots for lag identification
* Granger causality test (inflation impact validation)

### 4. Model Development

Five models compared:

| Model                            | MAE  | RMSE | MAPE  | Use Case       |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | -------------- |
| **Triple Exponential Smoothing** | 1.46 | 2.09 | 1.90% | Best overall   |
| ARIMA (0,0,2)                    | 1.39 | 3.14 | 23%   | Baseline       |
| SARIMA (1,0,1)(2,0,0)[52]        | 1.68 | 2.89 | 11.9% | Seasonal       |
| SARIMAX (1,0,1)(2,0,0)[52]       | 1.43 | 2.15 | 14.7% | With inflation |
| VAR (5)                          | 1.43 | 3.14 | 21.7% | Multivariate   |

### 5. Validation

* Residual analysis ‚Üí white noise confirmed (Ljung‚ÄìBox p = 0.71)
* Reverse differencing for original scale forecasts
* Out-of-sample evaluation
